GitHub Health Check
-------------------

Tools I can use to check up on the various accounts / organisations I have on GitHub.

- `check-repos.sh` -- look for open issues across all of my repositories for all of my accounts


## Notes

The GitHub API will limit the number of requests you can make per hour to (approximately) 60 requests. If you want to increase the rate limiting to (approximately) 5000 requests/hour you will need an personal access token. You can generate this token at https://github.com/settings/tokens.
